Disk LRU Cache
==============

A cache that uses a bounded amount of space on a filesystem. Each cache entry
has a string key and a fixed number of values. Each key must match the regex
`[a-z0-9_-]{1,64}`.  Values are byte sequences, accessible as streams or files.
Each value must be between `0` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` bytes in length.

The cache stores its data in a directory on the filesystem. This directory must
be exclusive to the cache; the cache may delete or overwrite files from its
directory. It is an error for multiple processes to use the same cache
directory at the same time.

This cache limits the number of bytes that it will store on the filesystem.
When the number of stored bytes exceeds the limit, the cache will remove
entries in the background until the limit is satisfied. The limit is not
strict: the cache may temporarily exceed it while waiting for files to be
deleted. The limit does not include filesystem overhead or the cache journal so
space-sensitive applications should set a conservative limit.

Clients call `edit` to create or update the values of an entry. An entry may
have only one editor at one time; if a value is not available to be edited then
`edit` will return null.

 *  When an entry is being **created** it is necessary to supply a full set of
    values; the empty value should be used as a placeholder if necessary.
 *  When an entry is being **edited**, it is not necessary to supply data for
    every value; values default to their previous value.

Every `edit` call must be matched by a call to `Editor.commit` or
`Editor.abort`. Committing is atomic: a read observes the full set of values as
they were before or after the commit, but never a mix of values.

Clients call `get` to read a snapshot of an entry. The read will observe the
value at the time that `get` was called. Updates and removals after the call do
not impact ongoing reads.

This class is tolerant of some I/O errors. If files are missing from the
filesystem, the corresponding entries will be dropped from the cache. If an
error occurs while writing a cache value, the edit will fail silently. Callers
should handle other problems by catching `IOException` and responding
appropriately.

*Note: This implementation specifically targets Android compatibility.*



Obtaining
=========

You can download a JAR of this library on the [GitHub download page][1].

If you are a Maven user you can also add this library as a dependency since it
it distributed to the central repositories. Simply add the following to your
`pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.jakewharton</groupId>
    <artifactId>disklrucache</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.1</version>
</dependency>
```

If you would like to compile your own version, the library can be built by
running `mvn clean package`. The output JAR will be in the `target/` directory.
*(Note: this requires Maven be installed)*



API
===

__public static DiskLruCache open(File directory, int appVersion, int valueCount, long maxSize)__

Opens the cache in `directory`, creating a cache if none exists there.

*Params:*

 * `directory` - a writable directory
 * `appVersion`
 * `valueCount` - the number of values per cache entry. Must be positive.
 * `maxSize` - the maximum number of bytes this cache should use to store

*Throws:*

 * `IOException` - if reading or writing the cache directory fails

-----

__public Snapshot get(String key)__

Returns a snapshot of the entry named `key`, or null if it doesn't exist is
not currently readable. If a value is returned, it is moved to the head of
the LRU queue.

*Throws:*

 * `IOException`

-----

__public Editor edit(String key)__

Returns an editor for the entry named `key`, or `null` if another
edit is in progress.

*Throws:*

 * `IOException`

-----

__public File getDirectory()__

Returns the directory where this cache stores its data.

-----

__public long maxSize()__

Returns the maximum number of bytes that this cache should use to store its data.

-----

__public long size()__

Returns the number of bytes currently being used to store the values in
this cache. This may be greater than the max size if a background deletion
is pending.

-----

__public boolean remove(String key)__

Drops the entry for `key` if it exists and can be removed. Entries actively
being edited cannot be removed.

*Returns:* `true` if an entry was removed

*Throws:*

 * `IOException`

-----

__public boolean isClosed()__

Returns `true` if this cache has been closed.

-----

__public void flush()__

Force buffered operations to the filesystem.

*Throws:*

 * `IOException`

-----

__public void close()__

Closes this cache. Stored values will remain on the filesystem.

*Throws:*

 * `IOException`

-----

__public void delete()__

Closes the cache and deletes all of its stored values. This will delete all
files in the cache directory including files that weren't created by the
cache.

*Throws:*

 * `IOException`
